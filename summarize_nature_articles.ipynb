      "Compressive sensing (CS) can extract subsurface details in active thermography efficiently by acquiring signals at sub-Nyquist rates with fewer measurements. This paper validates the application of CS in frequency modulated thermal wave imaging, showing its suitability for efficient reconstruction of thermal data and enhancing defect signature. The study experimented on a mild steel specimen with artificially simulated back hole defects, using the discrete cosine transform as sparsity prior and the orthogonal matching pursuit to reconstruct the original thermal response from compressed measurements.\n",

      "This study analyzed the impact of free-falling particle streams on different materials and the influence of wall roughness. A new drag force formula was implemented into CFD models, which better predicted particle rebound properties. The rough-wall model had a greater effect on smaller particles. Particle-particle collision was found to be the dominant factor in particle dispersion post-collision.\n",

      "The world's oceans have a lot of untapped geothermal energy, but exploration and exploitation are still in the early stages. This paper discusses three types of power plants for harnessing this energy and explores the technical, financial, and environmental aspects of offshore geothermal technology. Case studies from Indonesia and Italy are presented as examples, and the findings can be applied to developing countries in the field of geothermal.\n",

      "Active infrared thermography can improve bone density diagnosis, but has limited depth penetration. A nanoparticle coating approach using iron oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles with Gaussian-weighted linear frequency-modulated (GWLFM) excitation can increase compression qualities, sensitivity, and resolution. This study found that titanium- and iron-based nanoparticle coatings in conjunction with GWLFM can enhance depth penetration for bone density measurement.\n",
