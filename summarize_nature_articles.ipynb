However, further exploration is needed to understand potential differences due to the absorbed beam model, which could impact human life in the future by affecting the accuracy of radiation therapy treatment planning.\n",

The method uses the generalized evidence theory to model incomplete and unknown situations and make real-time decisions for actions to take. This could impact human life in the future by improving decision-making in air combat, potentially leading to more successful missions and fewer casualties.\n",
